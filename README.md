This is a simple Currency Conversion Application built using React and Axios to fetch exchange rates from the FreeCurrencyAPI. The app allows users to input an amount, select a base currency, and a target currency, then it fetches the current exchange rate and calculates the converted amount. The interface includes input fields for selecting currencies and a button to perform the conversion. The result is displayed in real-time based on the selected currencies and the amount entered.
